List of CHANGES from version 2.2.5 to 2.3

Feature changes:

- There are 61 new interfaces introduced in the new version. See details below.

- 9 interfaces has been removed. Carefully review information below.

- 6 interfaces has been renamed. All details and explanations below.

- Marker module has been re-implemented into a new database back-end. It uses now MonetDB for large table storage. It means vast improvements in speed and efficiency.

- Marker module now supports more than one dataset per analysis. Associated interface changes:
  * analysisgroup/_id/list/dataset
  * dataset/_datasetid/export/markerdata/csv

- Additionally to csv export there is now an option to list marker data in pages and column blocks. Added interfaces are:
  * analysisgroup/_analid/list/marker/_nperpage/page/_num
  * analysisgroup/_analid/get/marker/_id
  * analysisgroup/_analid/list/markerdata/_nperpage/page/_num/n/_nperblock/block/_bnum

- Now there is a full support for marker maps storage. New interfaces added:
  * add/markermap
  * update/markermap/_id
  * list/markermap
  * get/markermap/_id
  * markermap/_mrkmapid/import/mapposition/csv
  * markermap/_mrkmapid/list/mapposition/_nperpage/page/_num

- Concept of measurement units vocabulary has been re-worked. Now it is generic and centralized across the entire system. See renamed interfaces:
  * add/generalunit (from previous URL: add/itemunit)
  * delete/generalunit/_id (from previous URL: delete/itemunit/_id)
  * update/generalunit/_id (from previous URL: update/itemunit/_id)
  * get/generalunit/_id (from previous URL: get/itemunit/_id)
  * list/generalunit/_nperpage/page/_num (from previous URL: list/itemunit)

- Following the change in measurement units vocabulary concept, layerattrib table in Environmental GIS module has been removed and now uses generalunit table. Thus number of interfaces has been removed:
  * list/layerattrib/valuetype
  * add/layerattrib/valuetype
  * update/layerattrib/valuetype/_id
  * get/layerattrib/valuetype/_id
  * delete/layerattrib/valuetype/_id

- Units vocabulary now also support unit conversion rules. New interfaces are:
  * generalunit/_id/add/conversionrule
  * delete/conversionrule/_id
  * update/conversionrule/_id
  * list/conversionrule
  * get/conversionrule/_id

- Breeding method support has been extended. Now supports acronyms and better pedigree strings definitions.

- Specimen lists support has been extended. System user has a better control of ownership and sharing germplasm resources.

- Trial unit positions concept has been re-worked. trialunitpostion table and it's factor is no longer present in the database. trialdimension table has been introduced and relevant changes has been done to the trialunit table instead. Please, see database schema for model changes details.

Version 2.3
Date: 19/10/2015

Major:

+ Marker data is stored in MonetDB.

+ Config is moved from Common.pm to kddart_dal.cfg.

+ Workflow is supported.

+ Unit position is replaced with trial dimension.

Minor:

+ List user will return all users if the login group is the admin group with an ID of zero; otherwise the interface will return only the users in the current login group.

+ Support geojson for list and get trial.

+ Support filtering on null value.

Version 2.2.7

Minor:

+ Check max len for all varchar fields.

+ Change empty string to undef as the default value for datetime.

+ Change the temporary directory from '/tmp/kddart' to '/srv/www/tmp/kddart'. Apache2.4 on openSuSe 13.2 cannot write to '/tmp/kddart'.

+ Fix bug 886 which prevents '3>2.3,4' which is valid in Perl from being a valid boolean expression.

+ RANGE, BERANGE, LERANGE and RERANGE supports floating point numbers and negative values.

+ Google OAuth2 callback is supported. With Google OAuth2 support, DAL returns the username when the login or google oauth2 callback is successful in addition to the user id and the write token.

+ Support BOOLEX((x>0 and x<10) or x eq 'NA').

+ Admin user password is changed to 'kddartadmin'.


Version 2.2.6

Major:

+ Add, update, get and list and import markermap are available.

+ Count group by interface is available.

+ Cookie authetication is upgraded to check and protect files under storage directory which stores marker data and multimedia files.

+ Instance number is based on both TraitId and TrialId. In previous versions of DAL, instance number is like a auto number. From this version onward, instance number is incremented based on the specific trial.

+ GIS/Environment module: 2D layer type is supported.

Minor:

+ New interfaces to list marker in an analysisgroup.

+ Update layer supports changing layertype and geometry type if the layer does not any data yet.

+ Filtering parameter is available for update item.

+ Fix GenotypeSpecimenType perl variable declaration bug (#1735).

+ Fix update trial unit specimen bug (#1434).

+ Apache configuration changes for storage directory.

+ Fix instance number column which does not have data in export KDSmart data.

+ Export samplemeasurement csv can take TrialIdCSV as its additional filtering parameter. If TrialUnitIdCSV is provided as well, the export will only return the intersected records that match both TrialId and TrialUnitId filtering criteria (feature #1511).

+ Fix bug #1481 when the number of trait replicates for all the traits in the selected trial is all zero, DAL will return an error 'No trait selected'.

+ Fix bug #1776 regarding missing field in list layer and get layer interfaces.

Version 2.2.5

Major:

+ DAL HTTP error is changed from 401 to 420 for all errors, except for login required error, group selection required error, group administration required error and the errors in login/_username/_rememberme.

Minor:

+ Enable adding an empty plate without any extract.

+ List/field now returns field descriptions as well.

+ First release of online help for every interface.

+ login/_username/_rememberme is put back in the list of operations.

Version 2.2.4

Major:

+ Online help is available for some operations.

+ update/layer/:id is available.

+ Add SpecimenNote to specimengroupentry affecting list/specimengroup/:nperpage/page/:num, get/specimengroup/:id, add/specimengroup, specimengroup/:specgrpid/add/specimen.

+ Prior to version 2.2.4, add/specimengroup and specimengroup/:specgrpid/add/specimen used to take duplicate SpecimenId. Duplicate checking is in place in DAL v2.2.4.

Minor:

+ Fix download datakapture template link when the trial has no trial unit.

+ list/layer provides lastrecorddate for all the layer attributes which has data.


Version 2.2.3

Major:

+ Fix slowness in list small tables like list/breedingmethod. list/breedingmethod was slow in version 2.2.2 because for every breedingmethod DAL checks if this breeding method is used in specimen table or not. If it is not used, DAL will give a delete link. The fix for all list interface is that DAL checks if the record is used in other tables for the delete link in bulk. This improveslist/breedingmethod from 25 seconds to 400 milliseconds. Bulk checking for delete link and other related database record lookup is introduced in this version.

+ Add the filtering feature to list/sepcimengroup and list/itemgroup. This means that list/specimengroup and list/itemgroup are replaced with list/specimengroup/:nperpage/page/:num and list/itemgroup/:nperpage/page/:num.

+ Introduce list/pedigree/:nperpage/page/:num and list/genpedigree/:nperpage/page/:num.

Minor:

+ Make add/specimengroup to accept the situation when specimen is not provided. This is done by modifying specimengroup.dtd.

Version 2.2.2

Major:

+ Genotype alias has type, status and language fields. 
+ Introduction of genotype pedigree in addition to specimen pedigree. Genotype pedigree or gen pedigree is seen as the breeding history (pedigree) while specimen pedigress is seen as selection history.
+ Add/list multimedia files for genotype, specimen and site.
+ Being able to filter on factor columns in organisation, contact, site, trial and project.

Minor:

+ Listing genotype alias supports advanced features including filtering.
+ List genotype ancestor and descendant are available.
+ List specimen ancestor and descendant are available.
+ Add, list and get barcodeconf are available.
+ list/factor returns all fields in the factor table.
+ 'factor/table/:tname/add/vcolumn' becomes 'factortable/:tname/add/vcolumn'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2.1

This is a minor release to enable uploading large marker data files of more than several hundreds megabytes.

Major:

+ Changes in marker module schema in order to store marker data in the csv file
+ Import marker data is now based on a csv file storage system.
+ Export marker data is also based on the csv file storage system.
+ Export marker data supports filtering and field selection. Field selection is controlled by two optional parameters (MarkerMetaFieldList and MarkerDataFieldList).

Minor:

+ Analysisgroup has an interface to list the meta data fields.
+ Due to circular foreign key references between item and trialunitspecimen and other tables and time constraint, the foreign key references are not available in the database schemas embedded with this release.
