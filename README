# KDDart Data Access Layer (DAL) project

## DAL introduction

DAL is a web service data access gateway to KDDart databases. DAL is written in Perl using CGI Application framework. DAL web service interfaces are RESTful.

DAL can run in mod_perl or in normal cgi mode under Apache web server. It needs a fully qualified domain address like (kddart.example.com) to work. DAL cannot be accessed by its IP address directly.

## Directory Structure

* cgi-bin - This directory contains index.pl which contains all the RESTful URLs.

* other -   This directory contains all KDDart database files, scripts to install KDDart databases, test cases, scripts to run test cases, etc. These scripts in this directory are not DAL code. They help to setup KDDart environment like databases that DAL needs.

* perl-lib - This directory contains all DAL Perl packages.

* session - This directory contains some empty directories where DAL sessions are stored.

* vhosts - This directory contains the document root for Apache virtual host configuration.
